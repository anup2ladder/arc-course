# Program synthesis and the ARC challenge

This is the code for a short course on program synthesis and the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) challenge. The course is available as a website at [https://faustocarcassi.com/arc-course/](https://faustocarcassi.com/arc-course/).

> **Note** I am deploying the jupyter book website with Pages, and building it with a GitHub action (gh-pages isn't really working anymore). However, the Copilot button for launching the labs assumes that the full book is available in the repo under /docs. Therefore, as part of the action I am also copying the labs to /docs/labs. This is a bit of a hack - sorry for the slight bloat. Also note that the notebooks are all cached so they don't have to be ran by the action - it was becoming a headache to manage the dependencies.
