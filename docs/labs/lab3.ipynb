      "The examples provided suggest that a condition is being applied to the list which results in an empty list, regardless of the elements in the input list. This pattern indicates that the operation applied might filter out all elements based on a condition that none of the elements satisfy. One plausible condition is `gt(5)` since it removes all elements greater than 5, but since all input numbers are less than or equal to 9, which is not greater than 5, it may fit the criteria. However, we're looking for the opposite where none of these elements satisfy the condition, which indicates a stricter condition or a complex combination that leads to filtering out all. When examining conditions, one potential method is using `not_(even)`, and constructing a condition that somehow invalidates this for all elements. But we have a clue in input 3, which becomes an empty array indicating a complex or specific or pattern filter. Analyzing the context, one might consider operations like a reversal, mapping with no operation fit, or truncating at zero size (INT = 0) might be some valid fits, but not in the given CFG integer constraints.\n",

      "The given examples demonstrate the transformation of lists of integers by applying a function that filters out even values from the list and then applies a mapping operation to the remaining elements. Since the function for even integers is `plus(plus(INT))` and `plus(0)` is a constant function that always adds zero (as there is no even input), we can infer that the transformation is done with a constant mapping of `plus(0)`.\n",
