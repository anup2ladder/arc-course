{"responses":{"0":"<reasoning>\nTo understand how to transform the list of integers based on the given input-output examples, let's analyze the transformations:\n\n1. The first input `-[1, 7, 0]` results in `[9, 63, 0]`, where:\n   - The first element `1` is transformed to `9` (which is `1 + 8`).\n   - The second element `7` is transformed to `63` (which is `7 * 9`).\n   - The third element `0` remains the same.\n\n2. The second input `-[8, 9, 9, 8]` results in `[72, 81, 81, 72]`, where:\n   - The first element `8` is transformed to `72` (which is `8 * 9`).\n   - The second element `9` is transformed to `81` (which is `9 * 9`).\n   - The third element is the same as the second.\n   - The last element `8` again becomes `72`.\n\n3. In the third input `-[1, 4, 6]` results in `[9, 36, 54]`, where:\n   - The first element `1` is transformed to `9` (again `1 + 8`).\n   - The second element `4` is transformed to `36` (which is `4 * 9`).\n   - The third element `6` is transformed to `54` (which is `6 * 9`).\n\nFrom the examples, we can conclude that:\n- The transformation consists of applying a function (in this case, we can see we are adding 8 to the first and multiplying by 9 for the subsequent entries).\n- The operations seem to involve both `plus(INT)` and `times(INT)`.\n\nThus, to define this transformation in the context of the given CFG, we can create a composite function that applies these transformations to every element of the list.\n\nGiven the CFG,\n1. I will use the `map_` function to apply a transformation function to each element.\n2. We will define our operation as using `plus` for the first element and `times` for the rest.\n\nTherefore, I can create the expression as follows:\n\nLISTF -> map_(plus(8), LISTF) | map_(times(9), LISTF)\n\nThe simplest transformation that captures all cases accurately is:\n\nT -> compose(map_(plus(8), LISTF), map_(times(9), LISTF))\n\nSimplifying this, it would translate to a composite function that maps each element as described.\n\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\ncompose(map_(plus(8), LISTF), map_(times(9), LISTF))\n<\/answer>","1":"<reasoning>\nThe examples provided show how to transform different lists of integers through some process, ending up either with updated lists or empty lists. Each transformation suggests filtering or reducing the list based on certain criteria since the outputs are either reduced or empty. Notably, the first example results in a single item, while the second and third examples yield empty lists.\n\nBy analyzing the transformations, it seems that the goal could be to sum the integers in the lists, but only if they meet certain conditions (e.g., possibly being greater than a certain value). The provided CFG allows the use of functions like `filter_(COND)` which implies conditions under which numbers should either be included or excluded.\n\nWith that in mind, a possible expression could be:\n1. Filter out numbers using a condition (e.g. `gt(5)` would discard any numbers less than or equal to 5).\n2. Sum up the remaining numbers (if any) to produce the final list.\n\nThe function `map_(INTF)` could be used to apply an operation into the filtered values, and thus we could express this as: \n- compose(filter_(gt(5)), map_(plus(2)))... where `plus(2)` is an arbitrary example of what to do with the integers after filtering.\n\nThe intent, reflected through the examples, seems to closely align with applying a filter condition to remove undesired integers and then aggregating the remaining items to form the new resultant list.\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\ncompose(filter_(gt(5)), map_(plus(2)))\n<\/answer>","2":"<reasoning>\nTo deduce a corresponding expression in the given context-free grammar (CFG) from the examples provided, we need to identify the transformations taking place. \n\nThe transformations seem to indicate an operation that processes lists of integers by applying specific arithmetic operations and perhaps filtering or modifying them based on certain conditions.\n\n1. **Examining the First Example:**\n   Input: `[1, 4, 6, 5, 8]` \n   Output: `[6, 12, 16, 14, 20]`\n   - From 1 to 6, it appears to multiply by 6.\n   - From 4 to 12, it is multiplied by 3.\n   - From 6 to 16, it could be adding a constant +10.\n   - From 5 to 14, it also appears to be +9 or another consistent relation.\n   - Finally, from 8 to 20, it looks like it adds 12.\n\n2. **Examining the Second Example:**\n   Input: `[4, 1, 7]` \n   Output: `[12, 6, 18]`\n   - 4 becomes 12, likely multiplied by 3.\n   - 1 becomes 6, which could be multiplied by 6.\n   - 7 becomes 18, which appears to be +11 or multiplied by 3 and adjusted.\n\n3. **Interpreting Result Patterns:**\nThe transformations indicate a potential structure of combining the input list with a series of multiplications and possibly summations leading to an altered output.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\nBased on the patterns noted, the operations could be captured using the `map_` construct to apply some arithmetic transformations, reflecting the transformations noted in the examples. We can also filter out or truncate values depending on conditions that are inferred from the outputs observed.\n\nA potential CFG expression could be:\n`compose(map_(times(3)), filter_(gt(5)))`\n\nThis expression maps each input value to be multiplied by 3 and preserves those which are greater than 5.\n\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\ncompose(map_(times(3)), filter_(gt(5)))\n<\/answer>","3":"<reasoning>\nThe examples provided suggest a function that transforms input lists into output lists by applying a certain operation to the elements. Additionally, the resulting lists often contain negative numbers and may include zeros, indicating that there might be a specific condition that filters or maps the input values. \n\nAnalyzing the outputs, it seems that the transformation involves reversing the order of the input list and negating the values, combined with a filtering condition that removes certain numbers based on their values. The use of `filter_` suggests that only certain numeric values are retained in the final output. \n\nA fitting CFG expression for this transformation could be a combination of `map_` for negation and `filter_` for removing non-negative numbers, as shown below:\n\n1. `map_(minus(INT))`: This applies the negation to each element.\n2. `filter_(gt(0))`: This removes any positive number from the list.\n\nThis combination effectively captures the logic demonstrated by the examples. The final expression represents the composition of these two operations applied to `LISTF` which corresponds to the input lists.\n\nThus, the correct CFG expression is:\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\ncompose(map_(minus(0)), filter_(gt(0)))\n<\/answer>","4":"<reasoning>\nThe examples provided show transformations on lists based on certain conditions. The first example shows selecting 4 from the list by filtering out all odd numbers, as 7 is odd and 0 is even, leaving only 4. The second example shows filtering all elements from the list since all of them fail a condition (most likely being even), resulting in an empty list. The last example seems to suggest a filtering mechanism that leads to odd elements being filtered out, capturing the even numbers 4 and 2. Noticing a recurring theme, it appears that the filter condition is consistently aiming to retain specific numbers or discard certain conditions based on the evenness of the numbers in the input list. A potential representation in the context of the CFG would involve using filter along with a condition to select even numbers.\n\nThe expression can thus be captured using the following CFG rules:\n1. compose(LISTF, LISTF) can be used to represent a chain of transformations.\n2. LISTF can contain filter_cond to represent the filtering operation based on a certain condition like evenness.\n\nTo express the behavior demonstrated in the examples, an appropriate expression could be:\ncompose(filter_(even), LISTF)\n\nThe LISTF part can represent any initial list that it operates on. This effectively captures the conditions presented.\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\ncompose(filter_(even), LISTF)\n<\/answer>","5":"<reasoning>\nTo construct an expression in the given context-free grammar (CFG) that matches the provided examples, we need to analyze the transformations applied to the input lists to derive the output lists. The examples suggest that a particular operation is being performed on list elements, such as a mathematical transformation or manipulation.\n\n1. The transformation of `-[6, 0]` to `[10]` suggests that there is an underlying function that produces a single output based on the elements of the input list, possibly indicating some kind of aggregation (in this case, perhaps summation or a specific calculation).\n2. The transformation of `-[8, 5, 8]` resulting in `[12, 9, 12]` also needs to be examined closely, indicating that each element in the input list is being transformed independently.\n3. The last example, where `-[8, 9]` results in `[12, 13]`, follows a similar pattern of altering the input values to yield output values based on some consistent rule.\n\nSeeing the modifications from input to output, it appears that a constant addition might be occurring. Each output value seems to increase from its corresponding input value. For instance, adding 4 to the input elements seems to be a pattern that can be deduced. \n\nGiven that the rules listed in the CFG include operations on integers, we can utilize the 'map_' function combined with the 'plus(INT)' to accomplish this transformation. Therefore, to get the same results seen in the examples, we can express the operation as mapping each integer with a function that adds 4.\n\n<answer>\ncompose(map_(plus(4)), LISTF)\n<\/answer>","6":"<reasoning>\nThe provided examples suggest that we need to transform lists of integers based on certain conditions. It appears that the goal is to filter and reverse the list while maintaining specific criteria. In these cases, the resulting lists consist of only even integers in a reverse order from their original appearance (as seen in the first and third examples). The second example indicates that there are no even integers to extract. \n\nTo capture this behavior, we can construct an expression using the `filter_` function with the condition `even` to filter out even integers, followed by the `reverse` function to arrange them in the reverse order of their appearance in the original list.\n\nThus, the desired expression should first filter the input list and then reverse it.\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\ncompose(reverse, filter_(even))\n<\/answer>","7":"<reasoning>\nThe output lists in the examples seem to result from applying a transformation that sums specific elements of the input list. Observing the first example, the output [8, 12, 12] can be derived from the following transformations: the first element 3 and 7 yield 8 (3 + 5), and the repeated 7 yields 12 when combined with the next values. The second example shows that elements are likely consolidated as well, resulting in all 8 values. The last example sums all values for a consolidated transformation resulting in the output [6, 10]. \n\nBased on these observations, we can create a filtering transformation that sums each pair of elements together and consolidates the output to transform input lists with `plus` operations. I propose using the `map_` on the `plus(INT)` operation on pairs of inputs.\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\ncompose(map_(plus(1)), filter_(gt(3)))\n<\/answer>","8":"<reasoning>\nTo capture the transformation from the given input lists to the output lists, we observe that each output list appears to be the result of performing operations on the input elements. The examples indicate that we may need to use a combination of filtering and mapping functions from the provided grammar.\n\nFirstly, it seems that some values are being filtered out based on a condition. Observing the input lists, we can hypothesize that negative numbers or numbers that do not meet a specific condition may be filtered out. Additionally, the output values suggest that we also transform the remaining values by applying a mapping.\n\nMapping needs to be performed to derive the resultant values from the input elements. Notably, the patterns show that simple arithmetic operations such as subtraction might be involved. \n\nFurther analysis leads to the following:\n1. The function `map_` is likely needed to transform the integers (e.g., transforming the number into a specific output like subtraction).\n2. We would need to filter certain values based on some condition that aligns with the outputs produced (like filtering out specific integers).\n\nAfter analyzing the overall behavior, a plausible complete expression to represent the demonstrated rule is:\n``` \ncompose(filter_(gt(0)), map_(minus(5)))\n```\n\nHere, the filter would remove any integers that are not greater than zero, and then we map the remaining positive integers by subtracting 5 from each of them, which produces the output observed.\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\ncompose(filter_(gt(0)), map_(minus(5)))\n<\/answer>","9":"<reasoning>\nTo derive a suitable expression in the given context-free grammar (CFG), we need to analyze the examples provided:\n\n1. The first example, `-[5, 4, 0, 4] -> []`, suggests that there is a filter operation applied, which keeps elements meeting certain conditions and drops others. The result is an empty list, indicating that no elements satisfied the filter condition.\n\n2. The second example, `-[7, 9, 8, 8, 4] -> [6]`, indicates yet another filtering operation resulting in a list that contains a single element, `6`. This suggests that there is a transformation applied to the numbers (perhaps subtractive) or through some mapping that produces `6` from the filtered output.\n\n3. The third example, `-[5, 6, 9, 1, 5] -> [6]`, further confirms the presence of a filtering condition yielding `6` once again. \n\nBased on the repeated presence of the `6` in the outputs and the initial negative sign observed in the input list, it seems valid to assume we are performing a transformation that results in the subtraction of a constant value from each element, with the outputs being filtered accordingly. Specifically, based on the examples, it appears that we want to filter for values that result in being even or perhaps are above a certain threshold after applying some transformation.\n\nAn expression that combines these observations in accordance with the CFG would involve:\n- Using a `filter_` function along with a condition (most likely `even`), since all numbers are being processed for an output of `6` which is even.\n- Using a `map_` to transform the list with possible arithmetic operations (defining `minus(1)` to indicate that we are decreasing each element).\n\nThus an expression that fits these parameters can be structured as `compose(map_(minus(1)), filter_(even))` that will yield potential outputs such as `6` from the samples provided through various numeric inputs.\n\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\ncompose(map_(minus(1)), filter_(even))\n<\/answer>","10":"<reasoning>\nTo derive an expression that captures the outputs from the given inputs, we need to analyze the transformations performed on the lists. The outputs seem to involve transforming the input lists in a way that filters for even numbers and possibly modifies them by some constant. \n\nLooking at the provided examples:\n\n1. For the input list \\([-1, 0, 9]\\), we get an output of \\([6]\\). A logical transformation could be filtering even numbers and then applying a function that modifies them somehow. Since there is only one output of \\(6\\), possibly, it's a derived value based on the input numbers.\n   \n2. For the input list \\([-7, 7, 9, 0, 2]\\), the output is \\([4, 4, 6]\\). This suggests applying transformations (filtering) and perhaps mapping a function that generates certain results from the even numbers.\n\n3. For the input list \\([-0, 9, 5, 8]\\), the output is \\([6, 5]\\), indicating again filtering and transforming the numbers.\n\nFrom this insight, the filters on the even numbers from the input lists match the outputs upon applying a certain transformation. The significant operation also includes an addition to the filtered even numbers.\n\nTo generalize these operations, we could use the following approach using the CFG:\n\n1. Filter the input list for evens.\n2. Apply a transformation on filtered even numbers.\n\nCombining these insights, we can conclude that the final expression could look like this:\n\n- Filter even values from the list.\n- Map a plus operation to each of the even values to output a modified value.\n\nSo, the appropriate expression could be:\n\n```plaintext\ncompose(filter_(even), map_(plus(6)))\n```\n\nThis expression filters for even integers in the input list and adds \\(6\\) to any filtered result.\n\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\ncompose(filter_(even), map_(plus(6)))\n<\/answer>","11":"<reasoning>\nThe provided examples suggest that we are looking at a transformation of lists where we want to filter out elements based on conditions. In each case, the resulting list is empty. This could be achieved by applying a filter condition that eliminates all elements. To ensure that all elements are removed from the lists in the examples, we can use the condition \"gt(0)\" which checks if the elements are greater than 0. Since all tested inputs fail this condition, applying `filter_(gt(0))` to any of those lists will indeed result in an empty list.

Observing the outputs shows that all elements are eliminated. A suitable condition that can achieve this outcome is a filter condition that fails for all elements in the input lists. \n\nA useful approach is to use a condition that is guaranteed to be false for all integers provided by the INT non-terminal. Given the range of integers from 1 to 5 specified in the CFG, we could apply a condition such as `gt(5)`, which checks if any integer is greater than 5. Since all integers in the list are less than or equal to 5 (1-5), the filter will always yield an empty list.\n\nThus, the expression that reflects this transformation could be structured with LISTF as a filter applied to the integer list, employing the `gt(5)` condition.\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\nfilter_(gt(5)) \n<\/answer>","13":"<reasoning>\nTo understand the transformation of the input lists shown in the examples, we will analyze how each input list is being modified into its output. \n\n1. **Example 1: [-2, 1, 3] -> []**\n   This example appears to remove all elements. Therefore, it signifies some form of a filter that allows for no numbers.\n\n2. **Example 2: [-3, 5] -> [5]**\n   Here, the first number, -3, is filtered from the number 5. This suggests that there may be a condition to allow only positive integers.\n\n3. **Example 3: [-7, 2] -> [7]**\n   In this case, while 2 seems to remain unaffected, the negative number has been removed, indicating once again a filtering condition that favors certain numbers.\n\nFrom this analysis, it becomes apparent that an effective filter condition being applied is: keep only the positive integers in the list, or more formally, keep numbers which are greater than 0.\n\nSo, we will write a CFG expression that reflects this filtering:\n\n- We'll use `filter_(gt(0))` to define a filter condition that retains only numbers greater than 0. \n- We will also use `LISTF` for the list of integers being filtered.\n\nThus, we can express this transformation in the CFG framework.\n\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\nfilter_(gt(0)) \n<\/answer>","14":"<reasoning>\nIn the given examples, we can observe a pattern where certain elements are being processed in a way that results in a specific output. The transformation seems to involve filtering or mapping the elements in a certain manner.\n\n1. Looking at the first example, the input list `-[9, 8]` results in `[4]`. This suggests that we might be performing a filtering condition that removes elements based on their properties.\n2. The second example has the list `-[6, 7, 0]` resulting in `[2]`. This reinforces the idea that a specific criteria is being applied to obtain a filtered or transformed result.\n3. The third example, from `-[2, 5]` resulting in `[0]`, perhaps points to an operation that returns a constant or a derived value when base conditions are not met.\n\nConsidering the outputs, we need a filter condition that represents these transformations. If we assume we want to filter for even numbers and return their half (using the `plus` operation with definite results), we can use the `filter` function along with the correct condition.\n\nTo encapsulate these transformations succinctly, I propose the following extension representing the operation: filtering and applying a conditional transformation that suits the observed results.\n\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\ncompose(filter_(even), map_(minus(1)))\n<\/answer>","15":"<reasoning>\nThe provided examples show lists of integers being transformed into empty lists.

A suitable condition for this purpose is the `gt(0)`, which checks if each element is greater than 0. Since all the numbers given in the lists are either less than or equal to 0 in the provided examples, this filter condition will effectively remove all elements when applied.\n\nTherefore, the corresponding expression in the context-free grammar (CFG) will be:\nfilter_(gt(0))\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\nfilter_(gt(0))\n<\/answer>","16":"<reasoning>\nThe provided examples indicate that there is a transformation process involved where some elements of the input lists are being filtered based on a certain condition. Analyzing the examples:\n1. The input lists `-[7, 7, 6, 6]` and `-[2, 9, 6]` do not change because they don't contain any elements that meet the criteria for removal (suggesting a filter that retains all elements).\n2. The input list `-[3, 6, 0]` results in the output `[3, 6]`, where the `0` has been removed, which suggests a filtering condition that removes any zero elements from the list.\n\nGiven this, it appears we want to express a process that filters out zero entries from a list, while keeping the structure intact when there are no zero elements. The filter condition that would meet this requirement can be defined with a specific condition like `not_(eq(INT))` where `eq(INT)` would represent equality to zero.\n\nThus, we can express this as:\n`filter_(not_(eq(0)))` \nwhere `eq(0)` would need to be an additional condition defined in the context, but as per the given CFG it is permissible to represent conditions with not and and\/or constructs.\n\nWe do not have an explicit definition for equality in the provided grammar, so we would represent a filtering that logically addresses removing `zero` (if we consider the presence of zero specifically through the condition that includes negation). Since direct equality checks cannot be expressed, we elaborate a filter based on the examples observed, focusing instead on the present conditions, yielding a filtered condition of all non-zeros.\n\nThus, the expression will focus on filtering out `0`.\n\nThe expression capturing this could thus be generalized as:\n`filter_(not_(even))`  where `even` acts to consider all non-zero integers under general observation unless otherwise defined with specific conditions.\n\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\nfilter_(not_(even))\n<\/answer>","17":"<reasoning>\nThe examples demonstrate a transformation applied to lists of integers. The first transformation shows a mapping applied to each integer in the input list while negating the values and scaling them down by a factor of 2.

The last example indicates that a straightforward mapping to negative, filtered by the conditions mentioned previously, produces a new list with just the negated number equal to -2.\n\nBased on this, it seems that a combination of mapping and filtering operations captures the transformations shown in the examples. Specifically, using a combination that negates each integer in the list and then applies a condition to filter the results down to the desired output. \n\nA potential expression that encapsulates this behavior is to first use `map_` with the operation that scales and negates the integers, followed by `filter_` that keeps only the integers that meet a certain condition (in this case, those equal or above 5).

The third example clearly shows that an input can also result in an empty list, which reinforces the need for a filtering function that exists to remove all items based on a condition.\n\nOverall, this behavior can be represented as a composition of filtering and mapping functions. A possible CFG expression might utilize 'filter_' to eliminate unwanted values (like removing values greater than 2 or a similar condition that would yield an empty list) combined with a 'map_' function that transforms the elements, specifically using 'minus', likely with a constant value. \n\nBased on this analysis, a correct expression could be to filter based on a condition like 'gt(2)' and then map with 'minus(2)'.\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\ncompose(map_(minus(2)), filter_(gt(2)))\n<\/answer>","19":"<reasoning>\nThe given examples are filtering lists based on specific conditions.

The last example reorders the list [6, 0] to return it in a sorted form that places the even number (0) before the odd number (6).\n\nFrom the pattern of these examples, it appears we want to filter for even numbers from the list and potentially sort them. Given that the operation involves processing lists and the presence of the filter condition for 'even,' we can use `filter_(even)` in our expression.\n\nThus, using the command 'filter_' together with the condition 'even', we get a valid expression in the context of the defined CFG for filtering even numbers from a list.\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\nfilter_(even)\n<\/answer>","20":"<reasoning>\nTo determine the correct CFG expression that fits the transformations represented by the examples, we first need to analyze the inputs and outputs.\n\n1.

Moreover, the transform involves mapping elements but seems specific enough to warrant a filter or transformation condition.\n\nTherefore, the transformation can be expressed using `map_` as we need to apply a consistent function across elements of the input and then potentially use `filter_` to get the right elements if necessary or handle edge cases.\n\nGiven these transformations, an appropriate representation in the CFG would be:\n1. Use `map_` for the transformation on `INTF` which adjusts each element based on a consistent pattern found from the previous pairs of elements.\n2.

We would then apply this function across the list using `map_`.\n\nThus, the expression to represent transforming each element of the input list by adding 2 would be:\n\nmap_(plus(2))\n\nThen, the entire expression that carries out the transform on a list would be wrapped in the LISTF rule.\n\nPutting it all together, we can formulate the expression as follows:\n\nLISTF -> map_(plus(2))\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\nmap_(plus(2))\n<\/answer>","48":"<reasoning>\nThe transformation rules shown in the examples point to a need for a filtering operation that produces a list containing only the elements that are 0 or greater than or equal to 6.

Thus, we utilize an \"or\" condition combining these checks for our filter.

It appears that the rule applied here selects values that are either equal to 2 or greater than 2, which can be defined using a condition. \n\nTo convey this rule in the CFG notation, the most suitable transformation would be to use `filter_` along with the `COND` that checks for being equal to 2 or greater than 2. This can be expressed as `or_(eq(INT), gt(INT))`, where `eq(INT)` is an additional condition that we can assume exists for equality. \n\nI will define a hypothetical `eq(INT)` condition for expression purposes, capturing the described logic of filtering based on a comparison with the value 2.\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\nfilter_(or_(eq(2), gt(2)))\n<\/answer>","50":"<reasoning>\nTo derive the output from the inputs provided, we need to analyze what operation is performed on each element of the input lists.

For example: \n- In the first example, all numbers are greater than 6, so the list is unchanged.\n- In the second example, only 9 and 7 are greater than 6, hence they are kept.\n- In the third example, none of the numbers exceeds 6, resulting in an empty list.\n\nTo express this behavior using the defined grammar, I will use the filter operation with the condition of being greater than 6. The INT value '6' can be represented directly as 'gt(6)' in the grammar's COND definition. \n\nTherefore, an appropriate expression in this context would be:\nfilter_(gt(6))\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\nfilter_(gt(6))\n<\/answer>","73":"<reasoning>\nThe examples provided indicate that we want to filter a list based on a condition related to value.

To generate the list of numbers, we can use a LISTF production.\n2. The condition we identify is \"even,\" which is expressed via the COND rule.\n3. To actually create an example, we need to put together our LISTF, which could simply be a reverse of the list we're starting with, but for the purpose of just filtering out evens, we can directly filter the list using the appropriate function.\n\nBased on this understanding, we can construct the expression using the FILTER rule with the 'even' condition.\n\nOne possible valid expression would be:\n\n`filter_(even)`\n\nThis expression suggests filtering out only the even numbers from any underlying list or sequence fed into it.\n\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\nfilter_(even)\n<\/answer>","74":"<reasoning>\nThe given examples suggest a filtering operation that results in a list containing only the maximum number from the input list. \n\n- In the case of the first example, the input list is `-[9, 7, 4, 7, 0]`.

However, on closer inspection, since `4` is the only number meeting some criteria, perhaps a filtering operation on even numbers might make sense. \n- The second example `-[3, 7, 4]` outputs `[4]`, with `4` being the maximum in the list, leading to the thought that the condition has to do with filtering based on maximum.\n- The third example `-[6, 0, 3]` outputs `[6]`, which suggests the use of the maximum number again, confirming the pattern.\n\nGiven the patterns across the examples, it seems that a filtering operation based on being the maximum might be ideal.\n\nTo express this, we can use two operations: filtering based on a condition that identifies the maximum. However, to fit into our CFG, we could utilize `and` to clarify filtering based on maximum logic.\n\nSo the expression can be framed as such, by first determining condition, and then capturing this using one of the given operations.\n\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\nfilter_(gt(4))\n<\/answer>","75":"<reasoning>\nThe expression describing the transformation shown in the examples indicates that we're filtering out elements from a list based on a certain condition.

A potential condition that could lead to this result is filtering based on whether the numbers are greater than a threshold that all input numbers exceed, such as 5. Therefore, we can use the `filter_` function with a condition that checks if the numbers are greater than 5, ensuring that no elements remain, producing the empty list as an output. Hence, both `gt(5)` can be used effectively.\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\nfilter_(gt(5))\n<\/answer>","76":"<reasoning>\nThe given examples indicate that the resulting lists are derived by applying certain conditions to filter values from the input lists.

Finally, the third example shows that the list is empty when no values match the criteria. \n\nTo construct an expression that captures these behaviors, we can deduce that a combination of mapping, filtering, and using conditions is required. Specifically, the `filter_` function can be used to filter elements based on whether they are the maximum value in the list. This requires both identifying the maximum value and then retaining items in the list that match that maximum value.\n\nThe response will construct a sequence that finds the maximum (`max(INT)`) and then a filter condition for the maximum value. \n\nThis can be succinctly expressed using a combination of both filtering and mapping:\n1. A function to determine the maximum number from the list.\n2. A filter function that checks if each number is equal to that maximum.\nThus, the final expression can be structured as follows:\n\nWe can represent this behavior using:\n- A filter condition that uses `gt` to find if any number is greater than another, or reducing to just taking those which are the maximum.\n\nThe CFG expression would look like:\n`compose(map_(max), filter_(eq(max)))`\nWhere `max` can be determined through existing filtering and manipulation functions. This is assuming a user-defined function for `max`.\n\nHowever, since there is no direct `max` in the grammar provided, we will keep it simple with just filter.\n\nWe filter by `gt(X)` where X is a placeholder for the maximum value we need from the list.

In each case, outputs are derived from the inputs via operations that adjust or modify the values in a specific manner.\n\n1. The first transformation from [8, 4, 8] to [10, 6, 10] suggests that each number is either increased or decreased by a specific factor or value. The first element goes from 8 to 10 (+2), the second from 4 to 6 (+2), and the last from 8 to 10 (+2), indicating an addition operation.\n\n2. The second transformation takes [5, 4, 8, 8] to [10, 10, 6, 7]. Here, the number 5 is transformed to 10 (+5), the number 4 to 10 (+6), and the numbers 8 to 6 (\u22122) and 7 (+\u22121). This also suggests a combination of operations with some conditional adjustments.\n\n3. The final transformation [0, 4, 0, 1, 3] to [5, 3, 2, 6, 2] indicates that each input is transformed to a new output, but further analysis shows that 0 becomes 5 (+5), 4 becomes 3 (\u22121), while other values vary with similarly arbitrary adjustments.\n\nFrom these transformations, we can hypothesize that the operation combines two main rules: an addition (specifically the operation `plus`) and possibly a truncation or filter to moderate the values.\n\nGiven these hints, we can use the `map_` function that takes an `INTF` operation (like `plus(INT)`) and apply that across the list of values.\n\nThus, a possible correct CFG expression to encapsulate the transformation across the different examples shown might be `map_(plus(2))`. \n\nThis means we would apply adding 2 (as seen) to all elements of the input list to produce the desired output.\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\nmap_(plus(2))\n<\/answer>","78":"<reasoning>\nTo create an expression that captures the transformation shown in the examples, we can analyze the output based on the input arrays. The examples suggest that there's an operation happening to the elements of the input lists that results in the given output lists implying some numerical operation. \n\nLooking closely:\n1. The first case takes the input list `[8, 5, 9]` and produces `[2, 6]`, which suggests potential operations like preparing certain values that fit within a modifying function.\n2. The second example `[6, 1, 4, 6]` produces `[-2]`, indicating that there's likely a filtering or transformation that might produce negative results based on a certain condition or arithmetic operation.\n3. The third input `[2, 7, 3]` results in `[4, 0]`, which modularizes the list via a transformation that fits within particular ranges or conditions.\n\nGiven these transformations, we could set up the following functional expression: we might want to create a new list which includes some transformations via a map and then consolidate those based on filtering. \n\nA suitable expression that achieves such transformations could be formed by:\n- Mapping each number in the input through a function that creates new numbers based on a defined arithmetic operation.\n- Subsequently filtering the results based on thresholds or conditions set by the previous outputs.\n\nIn this case, we can use `map_(minus(5))` to subtract 5 from each number, and then filter using `filter_(gt(0))` to only keep numbers greater than 0, thereby mirroring the expected outputs. \n\nTherefore, an appropriate expression fitting the CFG rules while matching the example operations is:\n```\ncompose(map_(minus(5)), filter_(gt(0)))\n```\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\ncompose(map_(minus(5)), filter_(gt(0)))\n<\/answer>","79":"<reasoning>\nThe examples show a pattern of filtering a list of integers to retain only the even numbers.

To express this, we can make use of `COND -> even`, which directly correlates to the filtering operation performed in the examples. For instance, filtering the list `- [9, 0, 2]` should retain `0` and `2`, but since the output is `[8]`, it seems that there's another transformation or expectation at play, potentially implying that some additional aggregation or operation is assumed beyond plain filtering. However, the core operation remains a filter operation for even numbers, since the other examples filtered correctly verify that.\n\nAdditionally, since `filter_` requires a list of integers, we will represent the input list from which we are filtering as `LISTF`.

In the first example, transforming `[-3, -5]` to `[6, 8]` suggests that the first element `(-3)` increases by `9`, and the second element `(-5)` increases by `13`.\n2. In the second example, `[-1, -1, -7]` to `[4, 4, 10]`, we see that the transformation results in each `-1` becoming `4`, and `-7` becoming `10`, possibly through additions that are similar across the respective indices.\n3. In the third example, `[-9, -6, -6, -4]` transforms to `[12, 9, 9, 7]`, again exhibiting a pattern where increases by consistent values lead to the outputs.\n\nFrom these observations, it appears that the input list is being processed through some operation (possibly a `map_`) that consistently adds a specific integer derived from the input's length or the elements' negativity.\n\nThus, we can create an expression that captures some of this logic by using the `map_` function which will systematically apply an addition to each element in the input list. \n\nA reasonable choice for `INTF` in this context could be `plus(9)` since the first element in our first example needs a `+9` added to reach its new value.\n\nSo we can write out our full expression as `map_(plus(9))`.\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\nmap_(plus(9))\n<\/answer>","81":"<reasoning>\nThe examples show that the transformation consists of applying a function to each element of the input list that alters its value based on previous elements. The sequence of output values suggests that the transformation is related to a mapping operation that incorporates the concept of \"mapping\" possibly in combination with a potential cumulative effect from prior values. \n\nThe function that seems most fitting here is one that subtracts a value from previous sums or specific calculations. For instance: \n- In the first example, each element seems to have undergone some transformation involving subtraction where the output suggests the treatment of elements like their indexed position in the sequence or additional rules applied within a mapping function.\n\nGiven the examples involve a consistent transformation applied to an input list, the correct representation to encapsulate this behavior can be constructed using the `map_` operation of one of the `INTF` functions.\n\nAfter consideration, a `times` function could imply multiplying by a positional pattern derived from the list index, but no specific positional information is required from the examples. Therefore:\n\nA sound option could be a \"plus\" function which toggles behavior predictably based on the values found in the input list, suggesting positioning could be interchangeable given it processes sequentially.\n\nThus, for instance, `map_(plus(3))`, may represent one interpretation of augmenting list values while facilitating cumulative transformation on indexed elements, or could also imply a countable offset based that would vary the subsequent outputs.\n\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\nmap_(plus(3))\n<\/answer>","82":"<reasoning>\nThe provided inputs and outputs hint at processing a list of integers to produce a list with specific summed values.

The outputs show a pattern where we may want to apply a sum of certain filtered elements or the result of a mapping function. \n\nTo express this behavior in the context of the given CFG, we will use a `filter_` to include only those integers that meet a certain condition (likely non-zero), then utilize a `map_` to apply a processing function, probably `plus`, effectively summing them or performing addition. Thus, an expression that correctly matches the rule being demonstrated is a composed function that combines filter and map.\n\nIn particular, by filtering the input to only keep non-zero values and then mapping to sum those, we can yield outputs.

The critical observation here is that we only want the sums of certain pairs, which will likely require a helper function to define these pairs since the provided grammar does not directly specify a way to manipulate list elements other than mapping, filtering, or reversing. However, based on the CFG available, we can use `map_` to apply a function that captures the addition of pairs between the first half and the second half of the list. \n\nTo express this in the CFG, we can define an operation using the `plus` function on selected elements from a list. Since we need to aggregate sums from a pair of numbers (like the first and last or first two and last two), we will specifically denote the necessary INT assignment through `INTF` involved in the `map_` function.\n\nAn expression that captures this behavior effectively needs to sum the first elements with their counterparts, so I will construct an expression using `map_` in conjunction with `plus`.

This suggests that the output filters the input list to only show elements equal to 2. Since the filter function is applicable for creating such a selection, the `filter_` function with a condition that specifies to retain only the integers that are equal to 2 must be used.

Therefore, we can present this as a mapping function in the CFG.\n\nThus, we can formulate a `map_` expression using `plus(INT)` to add 8 to each element of the input list.\n\nWe can express this in the CFG as follows:\n- `map_(plus(8))`\n\nUsing the CFG, we can write:\n- `LISTF -> map_(plus(INT))` where `INT` = 8 (since it's a constant in our operations, 'plus(8)' fits the defined grammar).\n\nFinally, we can encapsulate this in a `compose` structure to emphasize the transformation operation, but since the examples just depict the transformation via `map`, we can simplify it to just directly using `LISTF`. \n\nThe valid expression in the CFG will thus be:\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\nmap_(plus(8))\n<\/answer>","170":"<reasoning>\nTo capture the transformation indicated by the examples, we need to observe the conditions under which an input list yields the specified output.

The second example also results in an empty list when at least one element is greater than 5. The third example outputs [6, 6] when the input includes 2, 4, and 7 which would be filtered by a certain condition.\n\nThis suggests that we need to filter the elements of the list based on a condition. Specifically, it seems that we are filtering for elements that equal 2 or are greater than 5. The output [6, 6] in the last example hints at a condition focusing on extracting duplicates or specific values greater than 5 based on the context of the input list.\n\nWe can express this using the CFG, where `filter_(COND)` is applied to filter elements according to the described logic.\n\nOne appropriate condition could be `or_(gt(5), gt(2))` to keep elements that are either greater than 5 or equal to 2. Then, we can leverage the `map_` function to transform the values appropriately (e.g., duplicating or altering them to produce the desired outputs).\n\nThus, we can summarize the expression as:\n1. Start with LISTF, apply filter to get rid of unwanted numbers\n2. Use a map function to perhaps duplicate or modify as required.\n\nTherefore, an appropriate CFG expression capturing the essence of these transformations could be:\n\nfilter_(or_(gt(2), gt(5))) on a LISTF followed perhaps by a map.\n\nPutting this all in a structured form:\n- Applying filter to a list such as [2, 4, 6, 7, 3] would typically yield values keeping them as per above logic.\n\nTherefore, a complete expression would be:\ncompose(filter_(or_(gt(5), gt(2))), map_(times(2)))\n\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\ncompose(filter_(or_(gt(5), gt(2))), map_(times(2)))\n<\/answer>","171":"<reasoning>\nThe examples represent a filtering operation on lists of integers where certain conditions lead to selecting specific elements or filtering out others. In this case, the pattern seems to suggest an operation that filters for the maximum even number from the list. We can observe the following:\n\n1. From the list [2, 9, 3, 4], the maximum even number is 4, but it does not appear in the resulting list [9]. This suggests a more complex filter where we might be selecting numbers based on their relation (the largest odd following certain even criteria).\n2. In the example with [2, 5, 3, 6], the even number selection does not yield anything that supersedes 5 which is retained as is. Hence the logic seems to output the largest odd number if applicable.\n3. Lastly, the list [0, 8, 0] results in an empty list, indicating no odd candidate is present when the numbers are all even.\n\nThus, we can construct a composite operation that checks each integer against certain conditions and only retains satisfying responses based on the maximum rules integrated with filters for odd\/even integers while neglecting those failing to meet evens or odd arrivals.\n\nGiven this, we can represent this functionally in our CFG as:\nfilter_(gt(5)) for retrieving those integers greater than 5 from a list and composing them with a mechanism to ensure they are odd.\n\nThus, a more conclusive expression might be derived from:\ncompose(filter_(even), map_(plus(1))) \nto derive results from inputs and operate through those segments controlling returns dynamically. \n\nTo clarify, the final output captures the essence of this filtering through:\n\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\ncompose(filter_(gt(5)), LISTF)\n<\/answer>","172":"<reasoning>\nThe expressions provided show a pattern where the output list is generated by filtering elements from the input list based on certain conditions.

The third example also results in an empty list from the input [1, 1, 2, 7, 2], and similarly suggests that all items from the list did not meet the filtering criteria. \n\nThese cases imply that we need a filtering condition that can remove multiple elements from a list based on certain criteria. A possible condition is to filter out all elements that are greater than or equal to 3, which would result in the empty outputs for the second and third examples while retaining numbers below this threshold in the first case.\n\nThus, the expression should utilize `filter_` with a condition that effectively discards numbers that are greater than or equal to 3.\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\nfilter_(gt(3))\n<\/answer>","177":"<reasoning>\nThe examples provided suggest a transformation of lists where each element appears to be altered by applying an operation that involves subtracting a certain value based on its position or value.

This aligns with the transformation from inputs like `*[4, 1, 4, 3]` to the output `[8, 2, 8, 6]`, as each number is indeed doubled.\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\nmap_(times(2))\n<\/answer>","194":"<reasoning>\nTo derive the outputs from the provided inputs, we can observe that the transformation seems to involve performing a series of mathematical operations on the array elements.

For the first example, transforming [0, 8] to [12] suggests that both elements are processed in a way that results in a single number, possibly through addition.\n2. In the second example, [3, 9, 2, 9, 1] transforms into [7, 13, 6, 13, 5], indicating that each element is increased, possibly through a function that adds a constant value calculated from their indices or some other derived method.\n3. The last example, transforming [0, 4, 7] to [8, 11], also hints at some summative operation.\n\nConsidering the notation in the CFG, a plausible representation for this behavior can be to use the `map_` functionality applied to an arithmetic function that manipulates each input based on some predefined value. \n\nA function such as `plus(12)` could work for the first example, but only for the first element. The arithmetic function could potentially sum a constant value as a transformation throughout the list.\n\nTherefore, one suitable expression to consider would be a `map_` function that utilizes `plus(INT)` on all elements with the appropriate `INT` defined to ensure the output matches what is shown in the transformations.\n\nBased on the input-output relations observed, using `map_(plus(6))` aligns well with how each number is being adjusted uniformly in the second example.\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\nmap_(plus(6))([3, 9, 2, 9, 1])\n<\/answer>","196":"<reasoning>\nFrom the examples provided, we can deduce that they demonstrate the use of the 'filter' function to retain specific elements from a list.

The second example, [0, 7, 3, 6], remains unchanged; in this case, it seems there is also filtering happening but the condition allows for multiple values. In the third example, [9, 5, 0] remains untouched as well, which could indicate that it passes some criteria. A reasonable conjecture for the filtering condition is that it retains even numbers (or odd based on context).

The third example retains only the number 3 from the input. \n\nTo define this behavior in the context of the given CFG, we can utilize the `filter_` function by creating a condition to ignore zeros and the `map_` function to ensure uniqueness, likely involving other constructs to ensure that we only collect the first occurrences. \n\nWe'll combine these functions and conditions in a suitable manner. Given that `filter_(COND)` could be used to filter out zeros, an appropriate filter condition can be defined as `not_(even)`, which will exclude zeros since even numbers include zero.

This suggests that we can use a function that checks the condition related to the difference between the two integers.

Moreover, the second example retains all values, indicating that there might be a no-op or identity condition applied. The third example, similarly to the first, also filters out values to keep only those that meet the same criteria. \n\nTo express this using the provided CFG, we can use the `filter_(COND)` function for the filtering process and `even` as our condition.

Observing the outputs, we can deduce that the transformation adds either 2 or 4 to each element, depending on the input values.\n\nTo express this in the provided context-free grammar (CFG), we can use the `map_` function, which allows us to apply a transformation to each element of a list.

We can define a condition that checks if an integer is equal to '6'. We can then compose this with another function that retrieves the preceding elements of the list.

To cause every element to be removed, we can devise a negation condition such as applying `not_(even)` on a filtering condition where even numbers should not be included, which effectively ends up removing all numbers. \n\nThus, a suitable expression to capture the transformation represented by the input examples would be `filter_(not_(even))` which would theoretically remove all integers since all of them can be presented as odd or non-even or as not satisfying the \"not even\" condition.\n\nThis can be validly expressed as part of the CFG rules showcased.\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\nfilter_(not_(even))\n<\/answer>","248":"<reasoning>\nThe provided examples show transformations on lists that suggest some filtering and sorting operations.

This suggests the output isn't a direct substraction but rather a filter\/condition that involves elements not meeting specific criteria, potentially applying an addition after filtering.\n\n2. The second example `-[5, 0] -> []` implies that subtracting produces no valid outputs (i.e., zero or negative results aren't accepted or filtered out).\n\n3.

We could use the `filter_` function with a condition to only include results greater than zero post operation. Putting this into a CFG-compliant expression, we could utilize `filter_` with the condition `gt(0)` to only retain positive numbers:\n\nWe will compose the operation using filter and the subtraction via `minus` specifically on integer values. \n\nThus, one suitable expression could be: `compose(filter_(gt(0)), map_(minus(5)))` operating on a LISTF of initial pairs or integers as necessary.\n\nTherefore, we can express this as:\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\ncompose(filter_(gt(0)), map_(minus(5)))\n<\/answer>","269":"<reasoning>\nThe given examples showcase how different lists are transformed into new lists through various operations.

Here, we could imagine an operation like mapping a function that performs addition and results in equal outputs.\n\nFinally, for `-[1, 7]` resulting in `[4, 10]`, we can think of a scenario where different combinations of the input values yield the output list.\n\nTo model this behavior within the rules of the CFG, we can use the `map_` function to apply an addition operation consistently across pairs of the input list. \n\nBy proposing that our resulting operation involves a custom defined function that operates via some internal logic to generate the outputs consistently, we conclude that `map_(plus(INT))` where `plus` refers to a function that needs to have defined behavior or selection criteria similar to the input list processing should suffice.\n\nThe CFG expression can be formulated to apply a `map_` on a function combining the inputs effectively, thus:\n\n```\ncompose(map_(plus(2)), sort)\n```\n\nHere I've assumed using `plus(INT)` is simplified for clarity and indicates elementary arithmetic applied within a mapping context.\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\ncompose(map_(plus(2)), sort)\n<\/answer>","292":"<reasoning>\nThe provided examples all show a transformation of a list by adding a certain number to each element. To represent this with the construct given in the context-free grammar (CFG), we can look at the following aspects:\n1. The first element of the output lists (e.g., 3 in [3, 3, 6]) corresponds to the last element of the input list incremented by 3.\n2. The second output element (e.g., 3) is simply the first input element incremented (0 + 3 in the first example).\n3. All subsequent elements seem to follow a similar increment pattern based on their position.\n\nBased on these observations, we can express the operations applied to the list. Specifically, we will define a mapping function, `map_`, that modifies the integers in the list based on some arithmetic operation (in this case, presumably adding a constant). However, since the rules in the CFG only allow certain types of operations, I could not directly map an increment operation unless I declare constants directly using INTF which allows us to use `plus(INT)`.\n\nTherefore, we can define a functional approach where for every element in the list, we are mapping plus a specific value (constant). Here, `map_(plus(3))` can be used to illustrate that each element in the list will be incremented by 3. This is a generic representation of the operation that fits the pattern shown in the examples.\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\ncompose(map_(plus(3)), LISTF)\n<\/answer>","293":"<reasoning>\nThe examples provided suggest that we are trying to create an expression that filters a list using a specific condition, particularly focusing on values greater than a certain number. \n\nLooking at the transformed results from the input lists, we can observe that:\n1. In the first case, values that do not meet the condition (greater than 1) are removed, resulting in a list of 7s. This might indicate that we are adding particular values based on a condition involving subtraction or filtering with a condition like 'gt(INT)'.\n2. In the second case, it appears that all values do not meet the condition, resulting in an empty list, which again supports the filtering aspect.\n3. In the third case, it looks like we are taking 5 and 6 and producing a new list with values that are not simply retaining but may suggest a mapping or altering based on some operation between elements.\n\nFrom this reasoning, it appears that we can create a function that filters the list based on a condition that checks if elements are greater than or equal to 3 and then we can map out the remaining values accordingly.\n\nTherefore, a possible representation of this processing sequence in CFG language could be:\n- Start with filtering the list with a condition that it should only retain integers greater than 2, then we apply a mapping function to perhaps transition these integers in some fashion (e.g., subtracting).\n\nAs such, a CFG expression that could reflect the behavior indicated could be `compose(filter_(gt(2)), map_(minus(2)))`, which will filter elements greater than 2 and then apply a mapping that effectively modifies them.\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\ncompose(filter_(gt(2)), map_(minus(2)))\n<\/answer>","294":"<reasoning>\nTo create an expression that captures the transformation shown in the examples, we need to analyze the output lists based on the input lists:\n\n1. In the first example, the input list `[-8, 4, 3, 3]` results in `[3, -1, -2, -2]`. The transformation appears to involve calculating the difference between the absolute value of the first element and subsequent elements in the list.\n   \n2. In the second example, with inputs `[-7, 7]`, we output `[2, 2]`. This suggests that the transformation involves creating a new list where each element is the absolute value of its respective index in the original list.\n\n3. The third example follows a similar pattern, where from `[-9, 5, 9]`, we obtain the output `[4, 0, 4]`. This again suggests an arithmetic operation is applied to derive a new list based on the input values.\n\nBased on the analyzed pattern, we can conclude that the transformation is about computing a new list where each entry is derived from the absolute differences involving the first element and the remaining elements. Thus, it appears suitable to implement this transformation using the `map_` function in combination with the `abs` and possibly simple arithmetic operations.\n\nTo encapsulate this approach, an expression that encompasses the essence of the transformation could look something like this:\n```\nmap_(minus(plus(abs(INTF), abs(INTF))))\n``` \nHere, `INTF` serves as a placeholder for the values in the initial list, and we will apply an operation to derive new outputs.\n\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\ncompose(map_(minus(plus(abs(INTF), abs(INTF)))), LISTF)\n<\/answer>","295":"<reasoning>\nThe examples provided show that certain lists are filtered to return empty lists. This suggests that the condition for filtering is likely a specific criterion that is not met by any of the elements in the given lists. One possible interpretation based on the provided examples is that we may want to filter out numbers based on whether they are greater than a certain threshold or based on whether they are even. Given the examples with varying lists of numbers, it seems plausible to use a `gt` condition to ensure that all numbers in the list are below a certain value, resulting in an empty output. \n\nGiven the numbers provided, if we filter using a condition that checks if the elements are greater than 8 (e.g., `gt(8)`), then any list that contains numbers all less than or equal to that value would be returned as an empty list after filtering.\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\nfilter_(gt(8))\n<\/answer>","296":"<reasoning>\nThe transformation from the input lists to the output lists suggests that each element of the input is being processed by a mathematical operation that modifies their values. Looking at the provided examples, it appears that the inputs are being modified by a specific combination of mathematical operations before being transformed into the outputs.\n\nBy examining the outputs in relation to the inputs:\n- In the first example, values roughly seem to be manipulated by a combination of increasing and decreasing operations.\n- The second example presents a different input list yielding results that suggest a scaling and shifting operation applied to individual elements.\n- The third example requires a smaller array, but the pattern of adjusting values remains the same.\n\nTo achieve such transformations, we can utilize a `map_` operation with an `INTF`. Each integer appears to be transformed consistently using certain operations:\n1. A combination of addition and subtraction.\n2. The ranges and outcomes suggest that `plus(INT)` or `minus(INT)` might be of varying values.\n\nThus, we can implement a mapping function that applies such an operation to integers in an expression using a few integer parameters which control how each number is manipulated.\n\nFor instance, a candidate expression could be:\n```\nmap_(minus(5))\n```\nThis effectively means that each integer in the list is decreased by 5, aligning well with the nature of transformations seen in the example outputs.\n\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\nmap_(minus(5))\n<\/answer>","297":"<reasoning>\nTo construct an expression that captures the transformations demonstrated by the provided examples, we analyze the input-output pairings:\n- The output lists appear to have a pattern based on the input values, and it seems that the operation performed results in a transformation that is not immediately obvious. However, since the approach from the examples shows the outputs are consistently of length two, it may indicate that the first step involves filtering followed by truncating the results. \n\nGiven the CFG, a suitable way to express this transformation could be via a combination of filtering out appropriate elements and truncating the output. \n\nAfter analyzing the examples, we can infer that a filter condition might be needed in order to produce results consistent with one of the sorting or mathematical transformation conditions. We would expect the use of a conditional function (`COND`) to narrow down the proper elements, and then truncate the final result into a size of two.\n\nUsing the filter condition `gt(1)`, it filters values greater than 1 from the list, and together with a truncate condition of `INT` of size 2 will produce the expected outputs from larger lists.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can construct the expression as follows: \n- First, we can filter the list to create a new list of values greater than 1.\n- Then we truncate the resulting list to keep the first two elements.\n\nPutting this together forms:\n`compose(filter_(gt(1)), truncate(2))`\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\ncompose(filter_(gt(1)), truncate(2))\n<\/answer>","298":"<reasoning>\nTo derive an expression that matches the transformation rules demonstrated in the examples, we need to analyze what is happening from the input to the output:\n\n1. In the first example, the numbers from the input list [-2, 5] are transformed to [5, 8]. Observing closely, it looks like:\n   - The second number (5) remains the same, while the first number (-2) is modified to produce 8 (i.e., -2 + 10 = 8).\n\n2. In the second example, [-5, 3, 2, 8] transforms to [8, 6, 5, 11]. Notably:\n   - The last number from the input (8) stays the same, while other numbers lead to adjustments that look like they follow a specific addition pattern.\n   - 3 increases to 6 (3 + 3 = 6), 2 increases to 5 (2 + 3 = 5), and -5 transforms (possibly by the same addition pattern).\n\n3. In the third example, from [-6, 8, 1, 2, 8], the output is [9, 11, 4, 5, 11]. Here:\n   - 8 remains unchanged, but -6 becomes 9 (-6 + 15 = 9), 1 becomes 4 (1 + 3 = 4), and 2 becomes 5 (2 + 3 = 5).\n\nAcross these examples, it appears that the transformation involves adding specific numbers (generally +10 or +3) to the input values to generate output values.\n\nThis pattern can be captured using a `map_` with an `INTF` operation that represents adding either 10 to the first or a constant value +3 to others. A specific expression that summarizes this process would be to use `map_` to apply our defined operation.\n\nThus, we can represent this transformation using the `map_` function in conjunction with a simple addition operation that encapsulates these findings.\n\nThe final form must include:\n- An outer mapping function that processes the list.\n- Operations to capture the defined transformation behavior which involves selection of whether to add fixed constants or maintaining certain positions.\n\nConsidering this, we can formulate an expression like this:\n<\/reasoning>\n<answer>\nmap_(plus(3), LISTF)\n<\/answer>","299":"<reasoning>\nThe provided examples suggest a need for a transformation that selectively removes certain elements from a list based on their values rather than applying general sorting or other operations. Since the results indicate that certain input values lead to an empty list while others produce specific outputs, it appears that we need to implement a filtering condition based on specific criteria such as keeping a certain integer present in the list or performing an operation that results in specific filtered outputs. The presence of the number \"2\" in the second example suggests that there may be a condition that checks for values and possibly involves operations specific to integer values to filter the original input. \n\nGiven this, a possible candidate for our function would be a filter operation utilizing a condition for preserving certain numbers or performing some operation connected to the values in the input lists.\n\nIn the CFG, we can create an expression that uses the filter function to keep those numbers that are greater than '2', as the outputs [2] and [] suggest that any integer below or equal to 2 are filtered out. \n\nUsing this thought process, I will construct a filter function that keeps only numbers greater than
