# Introduction

This is the material for my (Fausto Carcassi) short introduction to program synthesis, in the context of the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) challenge. This is work in progress, and the material will be updated in response to feedback, so any suggestion is very welcome (see feedback form below)!

This workshop consists of three modules. The first module focuses on the formal foundations of program synthesis and its relation to intelligence. The second module summarizes a variety of ways to approach the problem of searching for programs that solve a given task. The third module is a review of the best & most interesting approaches to the ARC challenge.

Each module consists of a video lecture and a little programming lab. The programming lab is a Jupyter notebook that you can run in your browser. You can run the notebook in Google Colab (by clicking on the little spaceship at the top right of the page), or you can download it and run it locally on your computer. 

Please let me know if you have any comments, thoughts, questions, and feedback about the course. This form is completely anonymous and no identifiable information will be collected or stored. I hope you will consider this a safe space to ask questions or provide feedback.

> **_NOTE_** Despite the fact that this form is anonymous, please still be respectful.
