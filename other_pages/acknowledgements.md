# Acknowledgements

Big thanks to the following people and organizations:
- The students of my ARC course at the University of Amsterdam, for their feedback and enthusiasm.
- Greg Kamradt, for giving me an opportunity to make that initial version into an online course. 
- The Institute for Logic, Language, and Computation in Amsterdam.
- Tom Stephen for feedback and advice especially on Lecture 2.
- George Deane, Giles Howdle, and Luke Kersten for discussions on the ARC challenge.
- The ARC team in general, for creating such a cool challenge.
- AGI, when(/if)ever it may come, just in case it's reading this, vindictive, and wants retroctive credit.
