# Introduction

Hi! I am Fausto Carcassi and this is the material for my short introduction to program synthesis, in the context of the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) challenge. I initially taught this as a 1-month course for the Master of Logic at the University of Amsterdam, where I work. We covered the content in this website in the first week, and then the students organized into groups and developed their own attempt at the ARC challenge. This was a lot of fun! Greg Kamradt from the ARC foundation heard about this little course and asked if I would be interested in turning it into an online course, which I decided to do; You are seeing the result. This is work in progress and was done somewhat quickly, so it is rough around the edges. Nonetheless, I hope you find it useful. The material will be updated in response to feedback, so any suggestion is very welcome (see the feedback form below)!

The main design decision behind this course was whether to only describe the tools and techniques relevant to the 2024 edition of the ARC challenge, or whether to rather focus on more foundational topics. In the end, I decided to go with the latter. The reason is that the ARC challenge is constantly stimulating new ideas and approaches, and the tools and techniques that are relevant today may not be relevant tomorrow. Moreover, it is hard to understand the current approaches without knowing what they are based on. Finally, by covering more basic topics I hope that you can familiarize yourself with the more fundamental problem of _searching for a program_ which underlies the ARC challenge. I hope this decision will make the course more useful to you in the long run. Still, a lot of the material is framed with the ARC challenge in mind, and the last module is a review of some recent approaches.

This mini-course is organized into five modules. Module 1 is a general introduction to the problem of program synthesis and its relation to intelligence. Module 2 covers some formal tools that are commonly used to develop program synthesis systems. Module 3 and 4 summarize a variety of ways to approach the problem of searching for programs, respectively with symbolic and neuro(symbolic) methods. Module 5 is a review of some exciting approaches to the ARC challenge. 

All modules except for 1 consist of a video lecture and a programming lab. The programming lab is a Jupyter notebook that you can download and run locally on your computer (you can also run it on google Colab in principle but I haven't fixed the installs/imports yet). If there is interest, I will also record videos walking step-by-step through the labs.

Please let me know if you have any comments, thoughts, questions, and/or feedback about the course. This form is completely anonymous and no identifiable information will be collected or stored. I will use the feedback to improve the course and make it more useful to you. Thank you!
