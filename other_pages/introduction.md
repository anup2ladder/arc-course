# Introduction

This is the material for my (Fausto Carcassi) short introduction to program synthesis, in the context of the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) challenge. This is work in progress, and the material will be updated in response to feedback, so any suggestion is very welcome (see feedback form below)!

This course consists of five modules. Module 1 is a general introduction to the problem of program synthesis and its relation to intelligence. Module 2 covers some formal tools that are commonly used to develop program synthesis systems. Module 3 and 4 summarize a variety of ways to approach the problem of searching for programs, respectively with symbolic and neuro(symbolic) methods. Module 5 is a review of some exciting approaches to the ARC challenge. 

All modules except for 1 consist of a video lecture and a programming lab. The programming lab is a Jupyter notebook that you can download and run locally on your computer (you can also run it on google Colab in principle but I haven't fixed the installs/imports yet).

Please let me know if you have any comments, thoughts, questions, and feedback about the course. This form is completely anonymous and no identifiable information will be collected or stored. I hope you will consider this a safe space to ask questions or provide feedback.
